# Red-List-assessment Analysis

#### Data downloaded from the IUCN Red List in January 2024. https://www.iucnredlist.org/en

Research questions:
1. Which classes have the greatest number of assessed species?
2. What is the assessment status distribution of the classes with the most assessed species, and how many percent of speceis are threatened in total??
3. Which classes have the least number of assessed species? 
4. What is the distrubution of  the total number of assessed species among the classes?
5. Which classes have the greatest number of exinct species?
6. Which classes have the greatest number of threatened species?
7. Is there a correlation between the number threatened species in a class and the amount of assessed species in a class?
8. Which classes have the greatest percentage of threatened species? (Only including classes with more than 100 assessed species)
9. Which 10 classes have the greatest percentage of extinct species? (Only including classes with more than 100 assessed species)
10. I there a correlation between number of threatened species and percentage of threatened species in the classes?



Results:
1. Magnolia Plants and Ray-Finned Fish were the classes with the most assessed species. 
2. The majority of the species had the status Conservation Dependent/Least Risk/Least Consern, followed by Threatened and Data Deficient. In total 28% of all species were threatened.
3. There were many classes with few assessed species. In total there were 35 classes out of 68 classes with less than 20 assessed species. 
4. The amount of assessed species per class varied greatly and were spread out from 1 -  51471.  Most of the 68 classes included in the Red List had few assessed species, with 75% of the classes having less than 454 assessed species, and 50% of the classes less than 17. 
5. Snails and Slugs, followed by Birds, and Magnolia Plants had the greatest number of extinct species.
6. Magnolia Plants had by far the greatest number of threatened species.
7. There was a strong correlation between the number of assessed species in a class and the number of threatened species in the same class. 
8. The class of plants Cyads had the greatest percentage of threatened species. Plants were dominatig the 10 classes with the greatest percentage of threatened species. Of animals, Joint-legged Arthropods had the greatest percentage of threatened species, while it in the Fungi Kingdom were Agaricomycetes. 
9. Bivalia, a class of freshwater and marin molluscs had the greatest percentage of extinct species, closely followed by Snails and Slugs.  Classes of animals were dominating the 10 classes with the greatest percentage of threatened species.  Of plants the classes Bryopsida (Mosses)	and Cyads had the greatest percentage of threatened species. 
10. There was no correlation found between the number of threatened species in a class and the percentage of threatened species in a class.
