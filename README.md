# IUCN Red-List Assessment Analysis
"Established in 1964, the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species has evolved to become the world’s most comprehensive information source on the global extinction risk status of animal, fungus and plant species." (IUCN)
Data was downloaded from the IUCN Red List in January 2024. https://www.iucnredlist.org/en
Uploaded and Analysed with Python in Jupyter Notebook
### Objective:
In this project, I wanted to investigate the overall comprehensiveness of the Red List, and if there are considerations that need to be taken if using the list as a guideline for wildlife conservation actions and measures.
